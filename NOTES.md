# Notes
- fix flickering screen
- remove specific window_ _create functions and make it more generic.
- remove tui_grid_t
- in chart, follow close price and render vertical line
- 'm' for month, 'd' for day, 'y' for year
- create stock_merge(stock, count) to merge values into each other
- remove STOCK_INTERVALS and STOCK_RANGES

## Maybe
- Remove rect argument and use child->_rect instead
- move is_inflated from parent to specific children

## Future
- fix tui_tab_forward and tui_tab_backward
- tidy up stock.h header library
