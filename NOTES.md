# Notes
- fix flickering screen
- remove specific window_ _create functions and make it more generic.
- fix tui_tab_ functions: only is_interact windows can be tabbed to
- 'f' for fullscreen in chart window
- list item is marked when viewing stock in chart
- search should only enter chart if stock was found

## Maybe
- utilize that tui, menu and parent has same fields (create generic functions)

## Future
- fix tui_tab_forward and tui_tab_backward
- tidy up stock.h header library
- create new menu with stock in table with HLOC values
